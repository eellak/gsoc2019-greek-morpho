## Project goals

During the summer a Morphological dictionary in sqlite3 format will be created.
Information will be extracted automatically with a python script and using
the pymediawiki library. In addition words and morphological information
will be added to the spelling tool dictionaries.

## Timeline

### Phase 1 (May 27 - Jun 28)

Creation of a parsing tool for Greek wiktionary that parses nouns, adjectives, verbs using Universal Dependencies POS tags

### Phase 2 (Jun 29 - Jul 26)

Addition of remaining parts of speech to the Morphological dictionary and
 addition of further information tags like toponyms and terminology extracted from page categories.

### Phase 3 (Jul 27 - Aug 26)

 Addition of extracted surface forms to Greek spelling dictionaries including words from reliable sources like European parliament translations.
